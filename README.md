## Introduction

Adalat ki Awaaz is designed to be a dynamic platform for news aggregation and processing. While the current structure includes components such as the `news_agent` (suggesting web scraping and data handling capabilities), the project is set to evolve with additional features that could help users stay informed on legal and justice-related topics.

## Features

- **Search Optimization:** Utilizes NLTK for keyword extraction, tags, and other techniques to improve searchability.
- **Metadata Extraction:** Tokenizes articles to extract keywords and generate metadata.
- **Automated Tagging:** Converts extracted metadata into key-value pairs for structured tagging.
- **Summarization:** Uses the BART model to generate concise summaries of articles.
- **Translation:** Implements the NLLB model to translate summaries into Hindi, Bangla, and Telugu.
- **Automated Publishing:** Publishes processed articles to WordPress via `wordpress_xmlrpc`.
- **Data Processing:** Utilizes Python along with performance-enhancing modules (C, CUDA, Cython) for efficient data handling.
- **Modular Architecture:** Designed for easy integration of additional features and improvements.
- **Future Enhancements:** Plans for advanced analytics and reporting to further empower users with actionable insights.

## Technologies

- **Python:** Primary language for developing core functionalities.
- **Django:** Robust backend framework.
- **Hugging Face Transformers:** DL model deployment and pipelining.
- **NLTK:** Natural Language Processing for keyword extraction and tagging.
- **BART:** Summarization model.
- **NLLB:** Translation model for multilingual content.
- **WordPress XML-RPC:** Automated publishing to WordPress.
