- **Modular Architecture:** Designed for easy integration of additional features and improvements.
- **Future Enhancements:** Plans for advanced analytics and reporting to further empower users with actionable insights.

## Technologies

- **Python:** Primary language for developing core functionalities.
- **C / Cython:** For performance-critical modules.
- **Cuda:** To leverage GPU acceleration in data processing.
- **HTML & JavaScript:** For any web-based components or interfaces.
